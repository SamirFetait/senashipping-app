This stability booklet comprises part of the Vessel’s data and must be kept on board the Boat at all times. It must be 
complete, legible and readily available for use. If this booklet should be lost or become unusable, a replacement 
copy must be obtained immediately. This handbook remains valid until revoked by a subsequent handbook or 
directive. The loading conditions shown in this booklet represent typical service conditions. It is emphasised that a 
separate calculation is necessary for all differing conditions of loading.

The Watertightness of All Openings and Bulkheads Is to be verified by Builder, Owner, Master and Maritime 
Inspection Department Surveyor.

DISCLAIMER: WHILE INFINITY MARINE CONSULTANTS (IMC) WORKS TO ENSURE THAT SAFE & RELIABLE STABILITY 
CALCULATION ACCORDING TO IMO CRITERIA, (IMC) IS NOT HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OMISSION, MISTAKE OR 
ERROR OF ANY PERSON IN CONTACT WITH THIS VESSEL.

*	The hydrostatics particulars are provided for the vessel at its design trim Conditions. When the actual trim of the 
Vessel is far from this design trim, the actual values of the hydrostatics particulars vary from those provided. 
This may result in the stability being over-estimated, every effort must therefore be made to keep the Vessel 
close to designed trim at all times.
*	Before operating the vessel all the watertight hatches /openings must be remain watertight sealed.
*	No tanks shall be filled exceeding the limits shown at the loading conditions.
*	Any operating condition violating the loading conditions indicated in the stability booklet may cause a certain 
danger to the vessel and its safety.

The purpose for the cross curves (or stability curves) is to enable the statical stability curves to be drawn in any 
sailing condition.

It is important to note that on the original Cross Curves the KG assumed was not found, therefore no correction was 
applied.

To obtain the righting levers for a particular displacement and KG the values of KN are first obtained by inspection at 
the volume concerned (i.e. displacement concerned). The correct righting levers are then obtained by subtracting 
from the KN values a correction equal to the product of the KG and sin Heel as shown in the following formula:

Righting Lever GZ	GZ = KN- KG sin ?	[m]







 

 Statutory Documents - IMO Publications and Documents - International Codes - Intact Stability (IS) Code - Intact Stability 
for All Types of Ships Covered by IMO Instruments – Resolution A.749(18) - Annex - Code on Intact Stability for all Types 
of Ships Covered by IMO Instruments - Chapter 3 - Design Criteria Applicable to All Ships - 3.1 General intact stability 
criteria for all ships.





3.1.1	Scope:

The following criteria are recommended for passenger and cargo ships.

3.1.2	Recommended general criteria:

3.1.2.1	The area under the righting lever curve (GZ curve) should not be less than 0.055 metre-radians up to 
? = 30° angle of heel and not less than 0.09 metre-radians up to ? = 40° or the angle of downflooding 
?f footnote if this angle is less than 40°. Additionally, the area under the righting lever curve (GZ curve) 
between the angles of heel of 30° and 40° or between 30° and ?f, if this angle is less than 40°, should not 
be less than 0.03 metre-radians.

3.1.2.2	The righting lever GZ should be at least 0.20 m at an angle of heel equal to or greater than 30°.

3.1.2.3	The maximum righting arm should occur at an angle of heel preferably exceeding 30° but not less 
than 25°.

3.1.2.4	The initial metacentric height GMo should not be less than 0.15 m.

3.1.2.7	Where anti-rolling devices are installed in a ship, the Administration should be satisfied that the above 
criteria can be maintained when the devices are in operation.

3.1.2.8	A number of influences such as beam wind on ships with large windage area, icing of topsides, water 
trapped on deck, rolling characteristics, following seas, etc., adversely affect stability and the 
administration is advised to take these into account, so far as is deemed necessary.

3.1.2.9	Provisions should be made for a safe margin of stability at all stages of the voyage, regard being 
given to additions of weight, such as those due to absorption of water and icing (details regarding ice 
accretion are given in chapter 5) and to losses of weight such as those due to consumption of fuel 
and stores.

3.1.2.10	For ships carrying oil-based pollutants in bulk, the Administration should be satisfied that the criteria 
given in 3.1.2 can be maintained during all loading and ballasting operations.

3.1.2.11	See also general recommendations of an operational nature given in section 2.5 above.





3.2.1	Scope:

This criterion supplements the stability criteria given in section 3.1. The more stringent criteria of section
3.1 given above and the weather criterion should govern the minimum requirements for passenger or cargo 
ships of 24 m in length and over.

3.2.2	Recommended weather criterion:

3.2.2.1	The ability of a ship to withstand the combined effects of beam wind and rolling should be demonstrated 
for each standard condition of loading, with reference to the figure as follows:

*	.1 the ship is subjected to a steady wind pressure acting perpendicular to the ship's centreline which 
results in a steady wind heeling level (1w1).

*	.2 from the resultant angle of equilibrium (?o), the ship is assumed to roll owing to wave action to an 
angle of roll (? 1) to windward. Attention should be paid to the effect of steady wind so that excessive 
resultant angles of heel are avoided; footnote

*	.3 the ship is then subjected to a gust wind pressure which results in a gust wind heeling lever (1w2);

*	.4 under these circumstances, area “b” should be equal to or greater than area “a”;

*	.5 free surface effects (section 3.3) should be accounted for in the standard conditions of loading as 
set out in section 3.5;

The angles in the above figure are defined as follows:

?o	=	angle of heel under action of steady wind (see 3.2.2.1.2 and footnote footnote)
?1	=	angle of roll to windward due to wave action
?2	=	angle of downflooding (?f) or 50° or ?c, whichever is less,



where:
?f = angle of heel at which openings in the hull, superstructures or deckhouses which cannot be closed 
weathertight immerse. In applying this criterion, small openings through which progressive flooding 
cannot take place need not be considered as open.
?c  = angle of second intercept between wind heeling lever lw2 and GZ curves.


3.2.2.2	The wind heeling levers lw1 and lw2 referred to in 3.2.2.1.1 and 3.2.2.1.3 are constant values at all 
angles of inclination and should be calculated as follows:

where:
P = wind pressure of 504 Pa. The value of P used for ships in restricted service may be reduced subject to the approval 
of the Administration;
A = projected lateral area of the portion of the ship and deck cargo above the waterline (m2);
Z = vertical distance from the center of A to the center of the underwater lateral area or approximately to a point at 
one half the mean draught (m);
? = displacement (t)
g  = gravitational acceleration of 9.81 m/s2

3.2.2.3	The angle of roll (? 1)footnote referred to in 3.2.2.1.2 should be calculated as follows:

where:
X1
=
factor as shown in table 1
X2
=
factor as shown in table 2
k

with:
OG =		distance between the center of gravity and the waterline (m) (+ if center of gravity is above the 
waterline, - if it is below)
d	=	mean moulded draught of the ship (m)

The metacentric height GM, the distance between the points G and M, means the stability for small 
angles and is given by the following equation:
GM = KMT – KG


The center of gravity (KG) above keel depends on the distribution of cargo in the vessel. By adding 
the single weights and their moments related to base line and by division of the total moments with 
the total weights, the center of gravity KG may be obtained.

The transverse metacentric (M) above keel (K) only dependent on the lines of the vessel, may be 
obtained from the hydrostatic tables.

Curves of righting levers:

Curves of righting levers are generally used to represent stability during inclinations. To ensure that 
the vessel's stability is positive, the stability arm GZ must be positive. To illustrate righting levers at 
various inclinations of the vessel in a condition, the effective righting lever GZ is derived from:
GZ = KMT - KG * sin?,  where KN = Cross curve ordinate above base line.

The righting levers GZ calculated in accordance with the mentioned formula are plotted over the 
angle of inclination

Free surface effects:

The 'free Surface Effect' of all oil, fuel, freshwater, feed water and service tanks should be taken into 
account in all conditions, when these tanks are not completely filled as follows:

Loss in GM [in meters] = (Sum of Free Surface Moments [in tons x meters]) / (Displacement of 
Vessel [in tons])

where:
Free Surface Moment = transverse inertia moment [m4] x density of tank content [t/m3]
